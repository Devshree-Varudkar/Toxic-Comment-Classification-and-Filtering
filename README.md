# Toxic-Comment-Classification-and-Filtering
The project aims to develop a systematic approach for
identifying and filtering toxic comments in online
platforms, thereby fostering safer and more inclusive digital
environments. In today's digital era, online communication
platforms serve as essential mediums for global
connectivity. However, the proliferation of toxic comments,
encompassing hate speech, harassment, profanity, and
threats, presents a significant challenge to maintaining
healthy online communities. To mitigate this challenge, the
project leverages advanced Natural Language Processing
(NLP) techniques to automatically detect and address toxic
discourse.

Online platforms confront a pervasive challenge: toxic
comments, spanning hate speech, harassment, profanity,
and threats, which undermine community health. The lack
of effective mechanisms to identify and address such
content compromises user safety and quality of discourse.
Therefore, there's an urgent need for robust toxic comment
classification algorithms using NLP and deep learning
techniques. These algorithms enable platforms to
proactively mitigate the spread of harmful discourse,
fostering safer, more inclusive digital environments.
